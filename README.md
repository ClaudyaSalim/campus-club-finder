# Campus Club Finder Website

Campus Club Finder is a website for active campus students looking for extracurricular activities or simply just search their interests. With this platform that we are building, students are able to explore various clubs and join them. This website was made with the popular [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) Framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Below is the guide to use the web.

## 1. Home
The Home page of this web shows a hero section with a welcoming message. The main purpose of this web is to look for clubs, so there is a CTA "Check it out!" button that if we clicked on it, it will direct us to a page consists of many clubs, called the Club page. We can also direct to Club page by clicking "Clubs" on the navigation bar.

## 2. Clubs
The Clubs page consists of many clubs that we can find and join them. The clubs are sorted by names from A to Z and displayed in grid view by default.

We can change the sorting to Z to A, and also change the display to list view by selecting the dropdowns in the page.

To know more about the club, we can click on the "View Details" button on each club. This will redirect us to the Club Details page, where we could check more information about that club.

## 3. Club Details
The Club Details page shows further details about that club, which is not shown in the Clubs page previously. We can have a closer look in the picture and description. We can also check their upcoming events.

To join a club, we click the "Join Club" button right next to the picture. After we clicked the button, it will disappear and a message that we have joined the club is displayed.

If we exit the Club Details page and enter the same club, we won't be able to click the "Join Club" button as it has disappeared before. This means the join action cannot be undone and the data has been stored in our website locally. However, we can also explore and join other clubs.
